# Email Producer (Java)

Email Producer is a library for handling the sending of emails via Kafka, the [CHS Email Sender](https://github.com/companieshouse/chs-email-sender) and the [CHS Notification API](https://github.com/companieshouse/chs-notification-api).

The aim of this package is to standardise the email-sending flow, abstracting away all of the serialisation and Kafka message building logic so that future engineers looking to add emails to their service are free to focus on application-specific things, such as the data being sent to the Notification API and the templates theyâ€™ll use to render the emails. The result is the ability to send an email with a single new Maven dependency, a few configuration variables and one method call.


## Requirements

In order to run the service locally you will need the following:
- [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting Started

The library is built using maven:
```
mvn clean install
```

The library can be imported as a maven dependency:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>uk.gov.companieshouse</groupId>
    <artifactId>email-producer-java</artifactId>
    <version>unversioned</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before your service will be able to send an email, you'll need to define a HTML and TXT template, and add it to the [`assets/email-templates`](https://github.com/companieshouse/chs-notification-api/tree/develop/assets/email-templates) directory of the [CHS Notification API](https://github.com/companieshouse/chs-notification-api). Once the templates are written, register them with the Notification API by adding an entry to [`assets/template_registry.yaml`](https://github.com/companieshouse/chs-notification-api/blob/develop/assets/template_registry.yaml). For example:

```yaml
'suppression_application_received':
  'html-template': "suppression_application_received"
  'sent-by-app-ids': [ 'suppression-api' ]
```

where:

* The **key** is the *type* of email you'd like to send. You'll use this key later when calling the Email Producer.
* `html-template` refers to the *filename* of the new email template, minus the file extension.
* `sent-by-app-ids` refers to the *list of service applications* that will use this email type. You'll refer to this `appId` value when configuring the Email Producer in the next step.



### Configuration

The following configuration variables are required to be set in your project's `application.yml` file:

 Key                       | Example         
 ------------------------- | --------------- 
 kafka.broker.addr         | kafka:9092      
 kafka.config.acks         | WAIT_FOR_ALL    
 kafka.config.retries      | false           
 kafka.config.isRoundRobin | 10              
 email.producer.appId      | suppression-api 



### Building An Email

The `EmailData` object defines the minimum required data to send an email - `to` (the intended recipient's email address) and `subject`. To add application data to an email, a new class should be defined which extends `EmailData` and includes attributes for storing the data. For example, from the [Suppression API](https://github.com/companieshouse/suppression-api):

```java
import uk.gov.companieshouse.email_producer_java.EmailData;

public class ApplicationReceivedEmailData extends EmailData {

    private Suppression suppression;
    ...

}
```



### Sending An Email

Once you've created your `EmailData` object, sending the email to Kafka is very simple:
```java
import uk.gov.companieshouse.email_producer_java.EmailProducer;

...

private final EmailProducer emailProducer;

...

emailProducer.sendEmail(emailData, messageType);
```
where:
* `emailData` *(`EmailData`)* is an instance of the data object defined in the previous step
* `messageType` *(`String`)* references the email type in the CH Notification API's template registry.



### Complete Usage Example

For a full usage example, take a look at the [`ApplicationReceivedEmailData`](https://github.com/companieshouse/suppression-api/tree/master/src/main/java/uk/gov/companieshouse/model/email/ApplicationReceivedEmailData.java) and [`EmailService`](https://github.com/companieshouse/suppression-api/blob/master/src/main/java/uk/gov/companieshouse/service/EmailService.java) classes in the [Suppression API](https://github.com/companieshouse/suppression-api) respository.
